Our standard escrow fee is 1% and the affiliate commissions are calculated based on the standard escrow fee, except the cases where the affiliate fee is lower than 1%. If the escrow fee is lower than 1%, the affiliate fee is calculated based on the lower fee.

Once your affiliate wallet balance reaches $10, you can transfer the bitcoin balance from your affiliate wallet to your Paxful wallet.

Payment methods are negotiated and exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis between the buyers in the Marketplace (“<strong>Buyers</strong>”) and sellers in the Marketplace (“<strong>Sellers</strong>”). Our users agree upon which payment methods to use to complete a transaction and are fully responsible and liable for using such payment methods in a lawful manner.","about_paxful_two":"Paxful also offers hosted digital wallet services through a leading global digital asset wallet provider. Our worldwide userbase is able to post offers to either buy or sell bitcoin in a variety of convenient methods. The creator of the offer is responsible for listing terms of the transaction, including the payment methods the Seller will accept. Once an offer is selected by another Paxful user, the Seller’s bitcoin are locked as part of our transaction procedures (which we refer to as “Paxful Escrow”) until all conditions necessary to consummate the transaction have occurred. The sale is complete and bitcoin is unlocked and released to the Buyer by the Seller once the Buyer has completed the terms of the transaction and payment has been confirmed valid and received by the Seller. Paxful does not act as a payment processor. All liability for sending and receiving PAYMENT and CONFIRMING the validity of the transactions lie between the buyer and seller. The bitcoin we lock is released back to the Seller if the Buyer chooses to cancel the transaction. The Seller may not cancel the transaction at any point. The Seller only has the option to unlock the bitcoin and release it to the Buyer. This is for the security protection for the Buyer. Should a Seller need to cancel the transaction due to a Buyer not following the terms of the transaction, they must start a dispute and provide a reason for doing so as further described in Section 8 of this Agreement. Transactions on our Website are conducted between the Buyers and Sellers. Accordingly, Paxful is not a party to any transaction.","about_paxful_three":"The hosted digital currency wallet service provided by Paxful is a secure method of storing, sending, and receiving digital currency. Paxful does not store or custody any bitcoin or any digital currency. Bitcoin, like other digital currencies, is always stored on its respective networks or blockchains. All digital currency transactions occur within the digital currency network, not on Paxful. There are no guarantees that the transaction will process on the digital currency network. Paxful reserves the right to refuse to process any transaction if required by law or if we deem the transactions to be against our terms and conditions in this Agreement.

Either party can initiate the dispute resolution process (“<strong>disputed transaction</strong>” or “<strong>dispute</strong>”) with respect to a transaction. Disputes can only be initiated on transactions that are marked as fully paid by the Buyer.
