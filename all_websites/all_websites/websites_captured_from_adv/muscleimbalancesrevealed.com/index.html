<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2224;">&#8220;It’s Truly a Gift that Keeps on Giving&#8221;</span></strong></h3>
<p>&#8220;Many trainers, especially myself, lack in the area of spotting technique and muscle imbalance issues with clients. In fact, I realized from MIR that by not addressing these imbalances, I was just exacerbating them each session! <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> gave me the foresight to spot things like tight hip flexors, which would help increase the neural drive to one&#8217;s lower body, which will help them lift more! That is just the tip of the iceberg of information found on these valuable DVDs. You will immediately become a more informative trainer in your practice after just one view of these DVDs (I view them all the time though! It&#8217;s truly a gift that keeps on giving).&#8221;</p>

<p>“My favorite session in this series was the session on Mobility &amp; Muscle Imbalances by Bill Hartman. I had heard a lot about mobility in the last few years, but I did not quite understand the difference between mobility and just doing stretches. This session cleared it up. One point that stood out is that when we lack extension in the proper places, our bodies will steal the range of motion from somewhere else. This has been an eye opener in that it has helped me focus on doing exercises &#8216;correctly&#8217; verses casually going through the motions, thinking I am doing something good when I am actually stressing the wrong body area. The session is also quite educational in helping one to understand where they are losing their mobility from. I agree that the points are areas of my weakness and I am working on them with a vengeance as I am in my 50&#8217;s and not getting any younger. I am combining many of these mobility exercises presented in the DVD with some rolfing and I am getting some range of motion back that I forgot that I ever had.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2224;">&#8220;Muscle Imbalances Revealed has Undoubtedly Filled the Gap I Had.&#8221;</span></strong></h3>
<p>“There is a wealth of information on treating injuries in my area from the medical field, as well as rehabilitation care from the physical therapist. However, the practice of &#8220;Corrective Exercises&#8221; and Assessments for Functional Fitness is still relatively new at the Personal Trainer level. Even at the institutional level, the bridge between Sports Medicine and Collegiate Sports Departments is sorely lacking. The complete program of <em>Muscle Imbalances Reveale</em>d has undoubtedly filled that gap me. I now have the knowledge and practical tools which I can quickly apply in a top-notch comprehensive training program. I have tested these in the gym and on the field, and can attest to the effectiveness of the MIR. My wholehearted thanks to Rick Kaselj and all the contributing experts of Muscle Balances Revealed, and the updates which are an added bonus.”</p>

In my experience, many new trainers lack a fundamental understanding of anatomy and dealing with muscle imbalances. This product goes into nice detail and gives you good cues to watch for, keep your clients injury free, and get them to where they need to be. As a bootcamp owner and trainer, I continually utilize the information I acquired in <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em>during my boot camp sessions, so that my members can enjoy health and fitness injury free.”</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> is a valuable addition to my “tool box” when it comes to assessing imbalances throughout the kinetic chain with athletes or the general population. MIR addresses injuries that may be caused by muscles imbalances that many times get overlooked. What I liked even more was the customer services and the updates to the program that are posted in the member area. With the vast information provided by MR, Hartman, Beard, Yates, Somerset and yourself any trainer, S&amp;C coach or PT is sure to take home valuable information.&#8221;</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em>Problem:</em></span> </span><span style="color: #008000;">Not Getting the Results Your Clients Want</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a fellow fitness professional, I know we focus on strength, flexibility and cardiovascular techniques with our clients in order to help them reach their goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve done this as well but what I was noticing was I was not getting the results my clients wanted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Therefore I headed back to school to get my Masters Degree in Exercise Science with a focus on corrective exercise and therapeutic exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I hoped this additional education and learning would be the missing piece to getting the results my clients were looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Even after all this learning and money, I was getting better results, but still was not fully <strong>helping my clients overcoming injuries, busting through fitness plateaus and staying injury-free.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I began to research what I was missing from my exercise toolbox when it came to getting the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>fastest and best results for my clients</em></span>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #227bdd;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em>Solution:</em></span></span> <span style="color: #008000;">Muscle Imbalances</span></h2>
<p>The missing piece to my exercise toolbox was muscle imbalances.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-589 aligncenter" title="puzzle" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/puzzle.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="302" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/puzzle.jpg 398w, wp-content/uploads/2010/07/puzzle-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px" /></p>
<p>I am not just talking about stretching what is tight, strengthening what is weak or doing some corrective exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle imbalances are much more complicated than that.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-658 aligncenter" title="corrective_exercise_mistakes" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/corrective_exercise_mistakes-300x277.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="277" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/corrective_exercise_mistakes-300x277.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2010/07/corrective_exercise_mistakes.jpg 457w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just focusing on three techniques of exercise will limit how fast your clients will reach their desired results, how quickly they will recover from an injury &#8211; and it won’t help them prevent injuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is important to expand from those three basic exercise techniques in order to <strong>get faster results, increase the speed of injury recovery and prevent injuries by moving your clients from imbalanced to balanced.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973" title="Muscle-Imbalance-to-Balanced" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Muscle-Imbalance-to-Balanced.jpg" alt="" width="629" height="76" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Muscle-Imbalance-to-Balanced.jpg 629w, wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Muscle-Imbalance-to-Balanced-300x36.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That led to <strong>Muscle Imbalances Revealed.</strong></p>
<div>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><em><strong><strong><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><span style="color: #aa2224;">Problem:</span> </span></strong></strong></strong></em><span style="color: #008000;">Courses and Conferences are Expensive!</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Fitness education is expensive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Just a few weeks ago, I attended a weekend fitness course and it cost me $2000.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>Ouch!</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The cost of the course was only one of my expenses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I also had to pay for: </span></span></p>
<p>&#8211; flights</p>
<p>&#8211; taxi to and from the hotel</p>
<p>&#8211; hotel</p>
<p>&#8211; meals (breakfast, snacks, lunch, dinner and drinks)</p>
<p>&#8211; I had to take time away from work and clients</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When all is said and done, it cost me about $3200.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">I have to say the material was good and I learned a few things but I could have learned all of it through a video presentation.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #227bdd;"><span style="color: #cc3345;"><em>Solution:</em></span> </span><span style="color: #008000;">Amazing Value! </span></h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-893 alignleft" style="margin: 8px;" title="Cost" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6c-ind-cost.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The amazing value is a huge reason why I love video presentations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have been teaching live fitness education courses since 1999.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest thing I love about video presentations, outside of convenience, is the cost of people attending a video presentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With video presentations you get all the benefits of attending a live course or conference, at a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>fraction of the cost</em></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You get excellent information with a focus on assessment and exercises, not to mention you have the presentation so you can watch it over and over again.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em><strong><strong><strong>Problem:</strong></strong></strong></em></span><span style="color: #008000;"> Who Has Time to Read Research Articles, Huge Textbooks or Go to Seminars?</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know you are busy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fitness professionals work long hours and it is difficult to find the time or energy to sit down and read a textbook on exercise physiology or to look up the latest research articles.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With our weekdays full of training clients or leading boot camp groups, it is difficult to find the desire to head to a conference or a course on the weekend.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Going to all those courses and conferences on the weekend leads to less time with family, friends and fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Who does not want more time with family, friends and having fun?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><em><span style="color: #227bdd;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #cf2f3c;">Solution:</span></span></span></em><span style="color: #008000;"> Sitting Back and Learning</span></h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-896 alignleft" style="margin: 8px;" title="convenience" src="wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6c-ind-conven.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last year, I discovered a way of sitting at my computer and having someone else teach me tips and tricks to help my clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The way this was done, was through<strong> webinars</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>I know you may be asking, &#8220;What is a webinar&#8221;?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A webinar is an online video presentation that is focused on great practical information which you sit back and view on your PC, Mac, iPod or iPad.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I watch them on my 7 year old PC.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You are able to view the video presentation off the internet or download it to your computer for viewing at another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Each webinar contains an outline of key information about muscle imbalances, images explaining muscle imbalances, videos of exercises and assessment recommendations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3474" title="What is Included in Each Video Presentation" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WhatisIncludedinEachPresentation1.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="262" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WhatisIncludedinEachPresentation1.jpg 647w, wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WhatisIncludedinEachPresentation1-300x121.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p>With each of the webinars you get a video recording, audio recording and handout that will work on your PC, Mac, iPod or iPad.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I know you might be thinking, &#8220;I have watched webinars before and could not download or burn the webinar to a DVD&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With most fitness education video webinars, you have to sit in front of your computer and watch the full webinar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Often times you lose the internet connection to your computer and you have to start all over again.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is very frustrating, inconvenient and a waste of time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Plus, most webinars you can’t download, you can’t burn to a DVD, and you can’t skip to the best part.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is NOT the case with <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em>. <strong>You can download, burn and skip to any part</strong> in the 5 lower body webinars and 2 bonus upper body webinars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-429" title="What-You-Can-View-It-On" src="wp-content/uploads/2010/06/What-You-Can-View-It-On.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="262" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2010/06/What-You-Can-View-It-On.jpg 647w, wp-content/uploads/2010/06/What-You-Can-View-It-On-300x121.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was at a fitness site and watched a free webinar.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The free webinar did not have much substance to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have watched numerous free webinars and have yet to watch one that was any good.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I find free webinars don’t have content that you can use to help your clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are often full of useless information or just promotion of more expensive products.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em><strong>Solution:</strong></em></span><span style="color: #008000;"> Content Rich Information </span></h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">The <em>Muscle Imbalance Revealed</em> webinars are <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>content rich</strong></span> webinars, that will help you get better results for your clients in 6 days!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will get tons of information on muscle imbalances for the lower body and exercises that you can use with your clients right way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The 6 presenters of the 7 webinars all provide you with a little background information but <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>focus on assessment, exercises and tips &amp; trips to help you get better results for your clients</strong></span>.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #227bdd;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em>Problem:</em></span></span><span style="color: #008000;"> No One Person or Profession Can Do it All</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would like to think with all the schooling I have done, the conferences I have attended, the textbooks I have read and the research papers I have gone through, that I would know it all when it comes to muscle imbalances. It is not possible for one person to know everything when it comes to muscle imbalances or even one profession to know all there is when it comes to muscle imbalances.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><em><strong>Solution:</strong></em></span><span style="color: #008000;"> 6 Experts in Muscle Imbalances from 6 Professions</span></h2>

<p style="text-align: left;">Instead of just revealing my tips and tricks when it comes to muscle imbalances, I sought out <strong>5 other experts</strong> in the area – Mike Robertson, Bill Hartman, Eric Beard, Kevin Yates and Dean Somerset.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As I was searching out experts in the area, I discovered no one person or profession has all the answers when it comes to muscle imbalances.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed – The Lower Body System</em> you get the perspective of a physical therapist, strength coach, corrective exercise specialist, massage therapist, kinesiologist, post rehab specialist and personal trainer.</p>

During the video webinar, Bill Hartman will teach you who should be and who should not be doing mobility exercises, why mobility is not flexibility, 4 exercises to help mid-back mobility and 3 hip mobility assessment tests.</p>

In this ebook, Nick Rosencutter shows you what he did to get back into lifting heavy weights. Nick was lifting heavy and began to develop muscle imbalances which lead to injuries and a decrease in performance. He began to look to see what could help him with his injuries and get him back to lifting heavy. He ended up meeting Mike Robertson and Bill Hartman. Mike and Bill finally figure out what was wrong with Nick and got him on the right path to recovery. Nick shares with you what Mike and Bill showed him, plus what he learned along the way to get from being injured to lifting heavy again.</p>

<p>“In order to stay current and relevant as a Personal Trainer in the very competitive fitness industry, you have to keep learning. No two clients are exactly alike, and everyone goes to a trainer for different reasons. As a trainer who always wants to know the &#8216;why&#8217;, it is important to rely on both credible and reputable people to provide the most insightful information out there. Rick Kaselj and his <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> program is worth far more than the investment. In fact, I&#8217;m surprised at how low the price is, especially since it comes with CEU opportunities. It is great to have access to reliable information, and <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> is definitely something every trainer should have to understand prehab and rehab protocols, assessment strategies and overall movement patterns. Rick Kaselj goes way beyond dysfunction and tackles the real underlying issues that cause many compensations throughout the body. I&#8217;m looking forward to his future projects.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a strength coach and trainer for over 10 years working primarily with master athletes, many of whom compete in endurance events such as marathons, triathlons and biking. Muscle imbalances are very common in this population so it’s a topic I’ve been researching for many years to help my clients avoid injury and improve their performance.</p>
<p>I’m very impressed with the quality of information presented in the MIR course and it’s given me some great tools to add to my coaching toolbox. I believe the best way to build your business is to get your clients results and I’ve built a six figure business by providing great service to my clients. This course will help you do that. Clients who get results will rave about your skills and nothing beats word of mouth marketing. This course will put you on the leading edge and separate you from the rest of the training crowd. It’s a solid investment which will pay for itself in no time.</p>

<p>“I cannot train the same again! I have already added to my clients training programs as well as my own.</p>
<p>The suggestion of utilizing a foam roller (supported by so many experts in the industry) has made me realize that I need to add more to my programs to achieve success. As a mind body instructor, breath work is always a part of my programming to alleviate stress, and I can see how breathing exercises do so much more physically, since we always focus more on the emotional connection. I now have proof to explain why the yoga and Pilates movements I prescribe (to create balance and alleviate pain) work, and more tools to add to my repertoire. <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> has provided me with new platforms to re-look at the whole picture, and ensure that what I prescribe will produce results, and assessments that make me feel comfortable referring to allied health professionals.</p>
<p>Finally, some fitness experts have come together to bridge the gap between rehab, functionality and exercise!</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>I purchased the fantastic MIR and had to drop you a line to say thank you. I have been training clients since 2004. I can remember many instances where I could see an issue a client had with a certain movement or exercise and I couldn&#8217;t address it. I feel that what you have done is bridged the gap between the basics that I learned to now being able to address issues directly. MIR gave me the catalyst to question what I&#8217;ve been doing for all these years but most importantly challenged me to go further and ask the right questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came across your package through Eric Cressey&#8217;s newsletter (I personally completed his Max Strength program and achieved great results) and immediately bought the webinars. What I didn&#8217;t realize at the time was MIR was the tip of the iceberg. My eyes have been opened to a complete shift in thinking and application when it comes to personal training. I have been particularly impressed with Kevin Yates simplified approach to what we do.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m trying to get through all this great stuff that you and your alumni seem to churn out at an amazing rate.</p>
<p>I actually now feel that I can make a real difference with this logical approach to training.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t thank you enough for reigniting my passion and enthusiasm for health and fitness.&#8221;</p>

<p>“This course has been far more informative and more in depth than I had expected. As a personal trainer and fitness leader this information is invaluable. I will definitely review it more than once, there was just so much useful information to take in all at once. It is one of the best investments I have made in a course in a long time.

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><strong>&#8220;These are DVDs that You Should NEVER let Out of Your Education Library.&#8221;</strong></span></h3>
<p>&#8220;I am glad I had the opportunity to review <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> by Rick Kaselj. These are DVDs that you should NEVER let out of your education library. We all know how good DVDs just &#8216;disappear&#8217; all of a sudden. I am not only writing this review from the eyes of a fitness &amp; sports performance coach but also a person that has suffered from knee and lower back injuries from my days in the US ARMY. <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> is an indispensable resources for coaches and fitness trainers with an &#8216;all-star cast&#8217; of some of the best rehab and post rehab exercise specialists in this business. It&#8217;s not a perfect world and eventually your athletes or fat loss clients will get an injury you need to work with and around. This program has enlightened me and added a new toolbox to help my clients in a more effective way and improve my own performance and past injuries I sustained while in the ARMY. <em>Muscle Imbalances Revealed</em> is a comprehensive and easy to follow program that I wish was around years ago. Not getting this program is leaving you unprepared for inevitable injuries that you or your clients may receive.&#8221;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #aa2224;"><strong>&#8220;MIR is Exactly What You Need to Differentiate Yourself from Generic Trainers.&#8221;</strong></span></h3>
<p>&#8220;One of the keys to my success as a personal trainer has been my ability to work with and around the nagging aches and injuries of people from 35-55, the very demographic that has the time, money, and demonstrated needs for our services.</p>
<p>The information you&#8217;ll gain in MIR is exactly what you need most to differentiate yourself from generic &#8216;just-make-em-tired-and-sweaty&#8217; trainers. Rick and the crew have done an outstanding job, and Bill Hartman continues to defend his title as &#8216;the Smartest Man in Fitness.&#8217;</p>
<p>If you want to elevate your skills and, therefore, your income, you need these DVDS. You owe it to your clients and to yourself to be the best you can be.&#8221;</p>
