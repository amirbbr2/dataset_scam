	<strong class="bbc">Addic7ed.com Official FAQ</strong>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">Keep in mind this FAQ assumes you have "English" as default site language</strong>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<span style="color: #ff8c00"><strong class="bbc">1. Previously on Addic7ed</strong></span>
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">A. What is addic7ed.com?</strong><br>
	Addic7ed.com is the source for most English TV <span style="color:#FF0000;">subtitles </span>on the internet. You can’t (and never will) find any video files here. Google is your friend on this one. The Addic7ed team provides <strong>ENGLISH </strong>subtitles, <strong>NOT </strong>translations. Our subs have <span style="color:#008080;"><em>our logo (or flag)</em></span> next to them, that's how you'llrecognize them. Translations aren't done by us but by regular users like you do. No need to ask us for them.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">B. Why subtitles?</strong><br>
	We like helping people. Hearing impaired people can benefit (a lot!) from subtitles, and we’re glad to do our part in helping them.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">C. How can I keep in touch with Addic7ed?</strong><br>
	You can find us on <a href="%22http://www.facebook.com/addic7ed%22" rel="">Facebook</a> , <a href="%22http://www.twitter.com/addic7ed%22" rel="">Twitter</a> , our official IRC channel (#addic7ed on EFNet) and of course, the Sub-Talk forums.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">D. How much does it cost?</strong><br>
	Addic7ed.com is a free service and will stay that way... however donations are always welcomed and rewarded with VIP status (read more about VIP below). They help us pay for the servers, and are the basis for our future redesign.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	You can support via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/addic7ed" rel="external nofollow">Patreon </a>for a monthly donation, via Bitcoin, or Paypal (contact us in private for the last two methods).
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong>E. </strong><strong class="bbc">What makes Addic7ed great?</strong><br>
	We are dedicating our time to provide quality subtitles in the shortest time possible.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	During the last <s><span style="color:#008080;">three four five six seven eight nine</span></s> ten years, we have developed guidelines for subtitle production and correction that help us, and anyone willing, in reaching our goal. We are open to your feedback in order to improve and perfect them.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	We welcome online translations / corrections: Members and users can correct a mistake they spot in a subtitle and the file will be instantly updated on the server, for anyone to download. That’s why you might see <em class="bbc">”Most updated”</em> on some files (more on this later).
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">F. Who makes it possible?</strong><br>
	People behind Addic7ed are awesome! No, really, they are. They’re volunteers too, meaning they do subtitles (even for shows they don’t watch) in their spare time, for free. People who upload our subtitles with our flag are official team members. This means they follow our team guidelines (when correcting, syncing etc). However, everyone can participate and improve subtitles (and we encourage all to do so) if they see some mistakes in the text itself.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">G. Why does your layout bring me back memories of the 90’s?</strong><br>
	Well, I agree with you. Graphics aren’t our thing... There were a few attempts to fix this, and they failed miserably. There’s a new thing in the works (<del class="bbc">again!</del> and again!) that might bring Addic7ed to 2018 looks.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">H. Why are you against subtitle requests?</strong><br>
	We have a lot on our minds (and schedule) already. We usually know what we have to release and we have a timeline for it. However, release times might vary.. so what today was released at 3PM, next week might be released at 8PM. As said above, we’re doing it in our free time and that doesn’t have a schedule.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	Requesting files won’t speed the process. Our motto is “when it’s done”, and most of the time, it’s been “done”.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	By all means, thank the sub-makers and, when it happens, report any problems, but:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>make requests for shows we do (those who have our logo), </strong>no matter how many days! Use the SubTalk Forums for special requests only.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOT </span>make requests for leaked episodes. </strong>Maybe they'll be done, maybe they won't. Most likely, you'll have to wait for the airing. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>make requests for translations. </strong>They're made by users like you. If users don't have time, there won't be any translations. So you either participate, wait, or keep your hands away from your keyboard. Anyone requesting translations over and over will be banned.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>post video links or refer to websites </strong>that contain video links for episodes. Try Google.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>post links to other sites for episodes we haven't done yet, or complain that some episode is on XXX site. </strong>Wait patiently (and in silence is even better).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>discuss shows or episodes </strong>- use the SubTalk Forums. You can give your opinion, but don't turn the comments page into a detailed analysis of an episode.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>post spoilers.</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Do <span style="color:#FF0000;">NOT </span>ask or whine about why it's taking so long, or any variation of it. </b>Doing so repeatedly may result in a ban. Syncers do have a life outside of Addic7ed.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you want to know if a sub will work with a particular episode/release, why not download it and try it? (It's quicker than asking about it.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Above all, respect the Addic7ed team, staff, and all users; abuse or discourtesy will result in a ban.</strong></span>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<span style="color: #ff8c00"><strong class="bbc">2. General Subtitle questions</strong></span>
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">A. When does “X” subtitle come out?</strong><br>
	Please read above. The “Why are you against subtitle requests” answer pretty much explains it.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">B. Why do some subs take time to be released/are released late?</strong><br>
	First of all, let’s define late. When I started watching TV shows (and Addic7ed was not even a domain name) I waited 1-2 days (even 2 weeks for Psych subtitles) for some subtitles to be uploaded to subtitle websites... and even that wasn’t “late”. We’re all humans and we do it in our free time. No free time =/= no fast release.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>C. </strong><strong class="bbc">Why do I often see a lot of mistakes and misspelled words in translation? (made on site)?</strong><br>
	Addic7ed.com has a "wikipedia like" feature. That means anyone with an account can translate a subtitle online. The good thing is, the more people work on a file, the faster it’s done... unfortunately the downside is that some people might make spelling mistakes. We’re constantly trying to correct such mistakes, by relying on our moderators. But we need your help to do it. Whenever you see errors in subtitles, please try to correct the file yourself or click the <em>Report </em>button so that moderators can do their job properly and check what has been done.  However, keep in mind that they too have a life.
</p>

<p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong>D</strong>. <strong class="bbc">I just uploaded 185 episodes of this cool series “El Chavo del Ocho” from 1978. Why you guys removed it from </strong><strong class="bbc">“New Releases”?</strong>
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	Well, no argument there. “El Chavo del Ocho” was probably a good series, and our website layout might look like it’s 1990 all over again, but the “New releases” section is only used for shows that aired “recently” (in human time, that means ~1 week).
</p>

</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">A. Why do I need an account?</strong><br>
	You can take full advantage of our services without having an account... however there are some limitations for visitors:
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<ul class="bbc">
<li>
		Can’t post comments / send PM
	</li>
	<li>
		Can’t upload subtitles
	</li>
	<li>
		Can’t translate online / edit online
	</li>
	<li>
		Can’t have a list of shows and episodes you’ve watched over time
	</li>
	<li>
		Can’t make personal RSS and follow shows you’re expecting subtitles for (more on this below)
	</li>
	<li>
		You’re limited to 15 files / 24 hours (more on this below)
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="bbc_left">
	Signing up is free and lifts most of the above limits.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">B. I registered but I can't log in. Now what?</strong><br>
	First, <span style="color:#FF0000;">you can only create one account.</span> So, if you already used your email in the past to create one, you can't do it again. If you don't remember your old account, or can't log in now, just visit the contact page, send me an email with your username you tried to register and we'll fix the problem.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	If you have an activation problem after clicking the activation email, try to log in. If it works fine, forget about the activation, it's not always necessary.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	 
</p>

<p>
	<strong class="bbc">C. I'm registered but I can't translate, edit or comment. Why?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	In order to do all of the above, <span style="color:#FF0000;">you'll need to wait a few days</span>. We set a limit for new users to avoid trolls. Don't ask how long it takes, we won't say.
</p>

<p>
	If you've been a user for more than a few days and can't do the above, then you've likely been blocked from translation by the moderation. Check your private messages.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">D. Which are the user classes?</strong><br>
	There are 3 classes you can obtain without much effort:
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<ul class="bbc">
<li>
		<strong class="bbc">Unregistered</strong> - Just visit the website

</ul>
<p class="bbc_left">

</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">F. Download limits? Not sure I like it! We’re talking 50Kb files here.</strong><br>
	You’re right. However, the download limit serves its purpose. The Addic7ed code had lots of optimizations done to better handle the download system. We have about 3 million downloads per month, so limits had to be enforced. This also prevented bots from mass downloading subtitles. I think the 40 files / 24 hours is a pretty reasonable limit for normal users. Limit may increase in time, so this values might change.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<span class="bbc_underline">Keep in mind download resets in 24 hours. If you download a file now, it will disappear from your limit 24 hours from now, not at 12AM tonight.</span>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">G. How do I check my limits?</strong><br>
	Go to your “<a href="%22http://www.addic7ed.com/panel.php%22" rel="">Panel</a>“. You’’ find the limit in the information box there (<em class="bbc">Downloads today</em> section). Clicking that will show you some detailed info about your last downloads.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">H. I downloaded a subtitle but the website counted 3 downloads, instead of one. What’s up with that?</strong><br>
	You’re most probably running a Download Manager / Accelerator. Please try disabling it and download a file. Should all work great after that. If your software supports it, make a rule to disable it on Addic7ed.
</p>

<p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>I. I donated but my account has not yet been updated to VIP</strong><br>

	<strong>A. </strong><strong class="bbc">What’s “Shows I’ve watched”?</strong><br>
	Ever wondered how many shows you saw or how much time you spent viewing them?
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	Well, that’s it. Just add shows / episodes you have watched to the list and you’ll get some interesting data out of it.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	Visit the episode page on Addic7ed and tick <em class="bbc">”Viewed”</em> or go to <em class="bbc">”Air Dates”</em> and look for a show to <em class="bbc">”bulk view”</em> entire seasons with one click.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">B. I can’t seem to find my way around the website!</strong><br>
	Addic7ed is very, very! easy to use. Unlike other websites, we have show pages and episode pages.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	Here’s an example of <a href="%22http://www.addic7ed.com/show/51%22" rel="">a show page</a> and here’s one of <a href="%22http://www.addic7ed.com/serie/How_I_Met_Your_Mother/2/1/Where_were_we?%22" rel="">an episode page</a> .
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	As you can see, the episode page has all the subtitles for that episode in one place (all versions, all languages).
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	There are 3 ways you can find subtitles on the website:
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<em class="bbc">By using <strong class="bbc">Quick Search dropdown</strong></em> - It lists all the shows we have. Click to open the list and start typing the first characters of the show; for example, typing “Priso” would most likely jump you to “Prison Break”.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<em class="bbc">By using the <strong class="bbc">search box</strong></em> - Pretty self explanatory.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<em class="bbc">By visiting “<strong class="bbc">Browse</strong>” located on top of every page</em> - Call this the “advanced” quick search if you want
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">C. How to upload files?</strong><br>
	This may be a little confusing at first, but trust me, once you do it 1-2 times you’ll find it simple.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	As explained above, we have episode pages.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	When you upload a subtitle for an episode that doesn’t exist (search every time before you upload anything) you must use the “<strong class="bbc">Upload</strong>” button located on top of every page.<br>
	This will create an episode page for the show you selected, with your subtitle as the first uploaded for that episode.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>To upload a subtitle for an episode that already exists</strong></span>, go to the episode page and click “<strong class="bbc">Upload a new version</strong>” located at the bottom of the file list (and above the episode comments).
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	A new version can be either another resync, a corrected file or a different language.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Reminder: <span style="color:#FF0000;">You can't create an episode for shows that we do. It means that if you try, the show in the dropdown menu will be greyed out. You're not authorized to upload it. You'll have to wait until our English subtitles are ready, and we create the episode.<br>
	Trying to bypass our systems may result in a ban.</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>D. Is there rules to follow regarding how subtitles should be?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there are. We don't accept raw subtitles on our site, which means that if subtitles have no corrections at all, we will delete them.<br>
	They must be:
</p>

<p>
	- <strong>NO MACHINE TRANSLATED SUBS ON OUR SITE.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	- in capitalized case (names ought to be capitalized, no capitalization after commas or at the beginning of each new sequence...)
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	- they don't contain long lines. Try to split them in half if they're very long. The team splits lines longer than 40. It's easier to read and doable in a few seconds with softwares like Subtitle Workshop, Subtitle Edit, Aegisub… But we don't split them in half if they're below 40 characters per line. Valid for non dialogue lines mainly. In any case, a single line of 70 characters for example, that's not readable. Keep it short, evenly, readable.
</p>

<p>
	Example:
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">Sequence 1</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">In the meantime, we're trying to hold the regime in Khartoum</span>
</p>

<p>
	change it to:
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">Sequence 1</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">In the meantime, we're trying<br>
	to hold the regime in Khartoum</span>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	- split sequences with long lines. Make it two lines on one sequence instead of a very long one.
</p>

<p>
	- no more than 2 lines per sequence for non dialogue lines. Same as above, split them so it's modified to 2 lines per sequence:
</p>

<p>
	Example:
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">Sequence 1</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">In the meantime,<br>
	we're trying to hold the regime<br>
	in Khartoum</span>
</p>

<p>
	change it to:
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">Sequence 1</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#0000CD;">In the meantime, we're trying<br>
	to hold the regime in Khartoum</span>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	- no 3 speakers per sequence. ONLY two maximum.
</p>

<p>
	- no dash on a line that isn't a dialogue. Example of what <strong>NOT </strong>to do:
</p>

<p>
	<a class="ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image" data-fileext="JPG" data-fileid="2790" href="https://www.sub-talk.net/uploads/monthly_2017_12/Capture.JPG.7a36aecb7525672593d6761d00aeb791.JPG" rel=""><img alt="Capture.JPG" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="2790" data-ratio="20.18" style="height: auto;" width="114" data-src="https://www.sub-talk.net/uploads/monthly_2017_12/Capture.thumb.JPG.ed60e69491d9119a9f15984a0488b670.JPG" src="https://www.sub-talk.net/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png"></a>
</p>

<p>
	- Inside a sequence, no speaker dashes on only one of the speakers. In this case, add the second speaker dash, (Subtitle Edit, Fix Errors, Add dash). It's all or nothing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>In order to tick the box <img alt="spacer.png" data-imageproxy-source="http://www.addic7ed.com/images/bullet_go.png" style="height: auto;" data-src="https://www.sub-talk.net/applications/core/interface/imageproxy/imageproxy.php?img=http://www.addic7ed.com/images/bullet_go.png&amp;key=676599d4ee881518f0dcf28770e238ac089c367deeb54646a7ee95a1e7cf36e4" src="https://www.sub-talk.net/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png"> "corrected" for your subtitles, in addition to the above specificities, it must contain all the dialogue dashes as well. One dash per line! If it doesn't fit, then your lines are too long.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>Example:</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>- Text A</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong>- Text B</strong>
</p>

<p>
	And if you have dialogues that are very unequal, find a way to adjust them. Don't put a speaker with just one word, and the second speaker with a 50 character-sentence. It's common sense.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>No super long lines on sequences. Avoid long lines as much as possible. We use a limit of 70 characters and find ways to resync them. The longer they are, the harder it is to read.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Most of the above can be done easily with Subtitle Edit (Fix Errors is one of the way), and it's quick, so there's no excuses. <strong>You're responsible for the content YOU upload.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	You can resync our subtitles to fit other versions. However, never modify them, alter them (unless there's text errors, missing dashes...). Keep the credits intact. You can add a line for your resync credit. In the comments box of your upload, you can add a line to indicate you resynced it from X version. When uploading them, keep the same properties. If they're corrected/HD/HI, tick the appropriate boxes. See explanation below for the icons.
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>Colored subtitles are allowed ONLY if you provide a non-colored version. They must be named "VERSION.Colored" to be differentiated by the system when downloading them. </strong></span>

	There are 3 type of downloads available:
</p>

<p class="bbc_left">

</p>

<p class="bbc_left">
	<em class="bbc">Download Original</em> - Someone edited the subtitle online and you can choose to download the version without the edits that someone made online.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	You click the small checkbox near each subtitle you want to download.

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	When you’re done, click the “Multi Download” button located at the bottom (you must be logged in).
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">

<p class="bbc_left">
	<strong class="bbc">G. How do I customize my subtitles?</strong><br>
	One great feature we offer is to customize subtitles “on the fly”.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	Go to your Panel -&gt; Edit profile and notice the “<em class="bbc">Remove italics</em>”, “<em class="bbc">Replace note</em>” and “<em class="bbc">Force ANSI</em>” settings.
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	Changing this will affect the subtitles you download. Don’t like italics? Just tick the checkbox and your future downloads won’t have lines in italics.

<p class="bbc_left">
	<span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>However, if you don't master your language, don't bother translating. You'll waste our moderators' time and everyone else who's participating by doing a bad job.</strong></span>

<p>
	<strong>D. Why are the translations so slow? Why does the percentage diminish?</strong><br><br>
	As said previously, translations are made by regular users like you. If no one has time or wants to participate, there won't be any done. No need to whine or be angry. That's how it is.<br>
	As for the percentage dropping, is we're notified of users doing a bad work, our moderators are there to deal with those, and remove their participation if it really sucks. If you're looking for fast subs poorly translated, go elsewhere. 
</p>

<p>
	And for French users (because they represent a big part of the translators), <span style="color:#FF0000;"><strong>READ </strong>all the rules. If you don't, don't be surprised you got banned for X reason. You were warned. Now, deal with it.</span>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	<strong class="bbc">A short lesson of history</strong><br>
	Along with honeybunny, I started Addic7ed back in 2008. We were two people totally new in the subtitle scene (both as contributors and as website administrators) and with little experience in translating / syncing. From a user perspective we thought the subtitle scene can be improved (in both quality and release times). That’s how Addic7ed was born. Slowly (but surely) we got visitors and team members. It was (and still is) a nice run and a nice experience that taught us a lot!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
	 
</p>

<p class="bbc_left" style="text-align: justify;">
	We met many awesome people (users and team members alike) that mean a lot! Without them Addic7ed can’t be possible so a huge thanks for that.

    "name": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "headline": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "text": "Addic7ed.com Official FAQ\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tKeep in mind this FAQ assumes you have \"English\" as default site language\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t1. Previously on Addic7ed\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. What is addic7ed.com? \n\tAddic7ed.com is the source for most English TV subtitles on the internet. You can\u2019t (and never will) find any video files here. Google is your friend on this one. The Addic7ed team provides ENGLISH subtitles, NOT translations. Our subs have our logo (or flag) next to them, that\u0027s how you\u0027llrecognize them. Translations aren\u0027t done by us but by regular users like you do. No need to ask us for them.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. Why subtitles? \n\tWe like helping people. Hearing impaired people can benefit (a lot!) from subtitles, and we\u2019re glad to do our part in helping them.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. How can I keep in touch with Addic7ed? \n\tYou can find us on Facebook , Twitter , our official IRC channel (#addic7ed on EFNet) and of course, the Sub-Talk forums.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. How much does it cost? \n\tAddic7ed.com is a free service and will stay that way... however donations are always welcomed and rewarded with VIP status (read more about VIP below). They help us pay for the servers, and are the basis for our future redesign.\n \n\n\n\tYou can support via Patreon for a monthly donation, via Bitcoin, or Paypal (contact us in private for the last two methods).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tE. What makes Addic7ed great? \n\tWe are dedicating our time to provide quality subtitles in the shortest time possible.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tDuring the last three four five six seven eight nine ten years, we have developed guidelines for subtitle production and correction that help us, and anyone willing, in reaching our goal. We are open to your feedback in order to improve and perfect them.\n \n\n\n\tWe welcome online translations / corrections: Members and users can correct a mistake they spot in a subtitle and the file will be instantly updated on the server, for anyone to download. That\u2019s why you might see \u201dMost updated\u201d on some files (more on this later).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tF. Who makes it possible? \n\tPeople behind Addic7ed are awesome! No, really, they are. They\u2019re volunteers too, meaning they do subtitles (even for shows they don\u2019t watch) in their spare time, for free. People who upload our subtitles with our flag are official team members. This means they follow our team guidelines (when correcting, syncing etc). However, everyone can participate and improve subtitles (and we encourage all to do so) if they see some mistakes in the text itself.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. Why does your layout bring me back memories of the 90\u2019s? \n\tWell, I agree with you. Graphics aren\u2019t our thing... There were a few attempts to fix this, and they failed miserably. There\u2019s a new thing in the works (again! and again!) that might bring Addic7ed to 2018 looks.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. Why are you against subtitle requests? \n\tWe have a lot on our minds (and schedule) already. We usually know what we have to release and we have a timeline for it. However, release times might vary.. so what today was released at 3PM, next week might be released at 8PM. As said above, we\u2019re doing it in our free time and that doesn\u2019t have a schedule.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tRequesting files won\u2019t speed the process. Our motto is \u201cwhen it\u2019s done\u201d, and most of the time, it\u2019s been \u201cdone\u201d.\n \n\n\n\tBy all means, thank the sub-makers and, when it happens, report any problems, but:\n \n\n\n\n\t\tDo NOT make requests for shows we do (those who have our logo), no matter how many days! Use the SubTalk Forums for special requests only.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo\u00a0NOT\u00a0make requests for leaked episodes. Maybe they\u0027ll be done, maybe they won\u0027t. Most likely, you\u0027ll have to wait for the airing.\u00a0\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT make requests for translations. They\u0027re made by users like you. If users don\u0027t have time, there won\u0027t be any translations. So you either participate, wait, or keep your hands away from your keyboard. Anyone requesting translations over and over will be banned.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post video links or refer to websites that contain video links for episodes. Try Google.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post links to other sites for episodes we haven\u0027t done yet, or complain that some episode is on XXX site. Wait patiently (and in silence is even better).\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT discuss shows or episodes - use the SubTalk Forums. You can give your opinion, but don\u0027t turn the comments page into a detailed analysis of an episode.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post spoilers.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT ask or whine about why it\u0027s taking so long,\u00a0or any variation of it. Doing so repeatedly may result in a ban. Syncers do have a life outside of Addic7ed.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIf you want to know if a sub will work with a particular episode/release, why not download it and try it?\u00a0(It\u0027s quicker than asking about it.)\n\t \n\t\n\t\tAbove all, respect the Addic7ed team, staff, and all users; abuse or discourtesy will result in a ban.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t2. General Subtitle questions\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. When does \u201cX\u201d subtitle come out? \n\tPlease read above. The \u201cWhy are you against subtitle requests\u201d answer pretty much explains it.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. Why do some subs take time to be released/are released late? \n\tFirst of all, let\u2019s define late. When I started watching TV shows (and Addic7ed was not even a domain name) I waited 1-2 days (even 2 weeks for Psych subtitles) for some subtitles to be uploaded to subtitle websites... and even that wasn\u2019t \u201clate\u201d. We\u2019re all humans and we do it in our free time. No free time =/= no fast release.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. Why do I often see a lot of mistakes and misspelled words in translation? (made on site)? \n\tAddic7ed.com has a \"wikipedia like\" feature. That means anyone with an account can translate a subtitle online. The good thing is, the more people work on a file, the faster it\u2019s done... unfortunately the downside is that some people might make spelling mistakes. We\u2019re constantly trying to correct such mistakes, by relying on our moderators. But we need your help to do it. Whenever you see errors in subtitles, please try to correct the file yourself or click the Report button so that moderators can do their job properly and check what has been done.\u00a0 However, keep in mind that they too have a life.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. I just uploaded 185 episodes of this cool series \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d from 1978. Why you guys removed it from \u201cNew Releases\u201d?\n \n\n\n\tWell, no argument there. \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d was probably a good series, and our website layout might look like it\u2019s 1990 all over again, but the \u201cNew releases\u201d section is only used for shows that aired \u201crecently\u201d (in human time, that means ~1 week).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t3.

If it works fine, forget about the activation, it\u0027s not always necessary.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. I\u0027m registered but I can\u0027t translate, edit or comment. Why?\n \n\n\n\tIn order to do all of the above, you\u0027ll need to wait a few days. We set a limit for new users to avoid trolls. Don\u0027t ask how long it takes, we won\u0027t say.\n \n\n\n\tIf you\u0027ve been a user for more than a few days and can\u0027t do the above, then you\u0027ve likely been blocked from translation by the moderation. Check your private messages.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. Which are the user classes? \n\tThere are 3 classes you can obtain without much effort:\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\t\tUnregistered - Just visit the website\n\t \n\t\n\t\tRegistered - Register, login into your account\n\t \n\t\n\t\tVIP - Obtained via participating in VIP giveaway contests, being a helpful member of the community or donating (one possible way is via Patreon and if you prefer PayPal, please contact us directly). There is no minimal amount required.\n\t \n\n\n\tOther classes are:\n \n\n\n\tTeam Member - Official team members (can be trusted uploaders, etc). Privileges: VIP+\n \n\n\n\tModerator - Keeping the website clean and tidy. Privileges: Team Member+\n \n\n\n\tAdministrator - All of the above... They\u0027re the big bosses.

Download limits? Not sure I like it! We\u2019re talking 50Kb files here. \n\tYou\u2019re right. However, the download limit serves its purpose. The Addic7ed code had lots of optimizations done to better handle the download system. We have about 3 million downloads per month, so limits had to be enforced. This also prevented bots from mass downloading subtitles. I think the 40 files / 24 hours is a pretty reasonable limit for normal users. Limit may increase in time, so this values might change.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tKeep in mind download resets in 24 hours. If you download a file now, it will disappear from your limit 24 hours from now, not at 12AM tonight.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. How do I check my limits? \n\tGo to your \u201cPanel\u201c. You\u2019\u2019 find the limit in the information box there (Downloads today section). Clicking that will show you some detailed info about your last downloads.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. I downloaded a subtitle but the website counted 3 downloads, instead of one. What\u2019s up with that? \n\tYou\u2019re most probably running a Download Manager / Accelerator. Please try disabling it and download a file. Should all work great after that. If your software supports it, make a rule to disable it on Addic7ed.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tI. I donated but my account has not yet been updated to VIP \n\tThe only reason is because you have to warn us after you make a donation, if you haven\u0027t specified your username. Just send an email to chamallow@addic7ed.com with your PayPal email or transaction ID and your Addic7ed.com username and it will be updated as soon as possible.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tJ. How do I manage my account? \n\tYou can click the \u201cMy Panel\u201d button on top of every page. You will find there settings such as change password, set gender, hide online status, or subtitle specific settings like remove italics (read below).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tK. How do I get an avatar? \n\tWell, this one is rather simple. Go to Gravatar.com and assign an avatar to your email address. It will automatically be updated on Addic7ed too (if you used the same email address when you registered your account).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t4. General Website Features\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. What\u2019s \u201cShows I\u2019ve watched\u201d? \n\tEver wondered how many shows you saw or how much time you spent viewing them?\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWell, that\u2019s it. Just add shows / episodes you have watched to the list and you\u2019ll get some interesting data out of it.\n \n\n\n\tVisit the episode page on Addic7ed and tick \u201dViewed\u201d or go to \u201dAir Dates\u201d and look for a show to \u201dbulk view\u201d entire seasons with one click.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. I can\u2019t seem to find my way around the website! \n\tAddic7ed is very, very! easy to use. Unlike other websites, we have show pages and episode pages.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tHere\u2019s an example of a show page and here\u2019s one of an episode page .\n \n\n\n\tAs you can see, the episode page has all the subtitles for that episode in one place (all versions, all languages).\n \n\n\n\tThere are 3 ways you can find subtitles on the website:\n \n\n\n\tBy using Quick Search dropdown - It lists all the shows we have. Click to open the list and start typing the first characters of the show; for example, typing \u201cPriso\u201d would most likely jump you to \u201cPrison Break\u201d.\n \n\n\n\tBy using the search box - Pretty self explanatory.\n \n\n\n\tBy visiting \u201cBrowse\u201d located on top of every page - Call this the \u201cadvanced\u201d quick search if you want\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. How to upload files? \n\tThis may be a little confusing at first, but trust me, once you do it 1-2 times you\u2019ll find it simple.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tAs explained above, we have episode pages.\n \n\n\n\tWhen you upload a subtitle for an episode that doesn\u2019t exist (search every time before you upload anything) you must use the \u201cUpload\u201d button located on top of every page. \n\tThis will create an episode page for the show you selected, with your subtitle as the first uploaded for that episode.\n \n\n\n\tTo upload a subtitle for an episode that already exists, go to the episode page and click \u201cUpload a new version\u201d located at the bottom of the file list (and above the episode comments).\n \n\n\n\tA new version can be either another resync, a corrected file or a different language.\n \n\n\n\tReminder: You can\u0027t create an episode for shows that we do. It means that if you try, the show in the dropdown menu will be greyed out. You\u0027re not authorized to upload it. You\u0027ll have to wait until our English subtitles are ready, and we create the episode. \n\tTrying to bypass our systems may result in a ban.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. Is there rules to follow regarding how subtitles should be?\n \n\n\n\tYes, there are. We don\u0027t accept raw subtitles on our site, which means that if subtitles have no corrections at all, we will delete them. \n\tThey must be:\n \n\n\n\t- NO MACHINE TRANSLATED SUBS ON OUR SITE.\n \n\n\n\t- in capitalized case (names ought to be capitalized, no capitalization after commas or at the beginning of each new sequence...)\n \n\n\n\t \n\t- they don\u0027t contain long lines. Try to split them in half if they\u0027re very long. The team splits lines longer than 40. It\u0027s easier to read and doable in a few seconds with softwares like Subtitle Workshop, Subtitle Edit, Aegisub\u2026 But we don\u0027t split them in half if they\u0027re below 40 characters per line. Valid for non dialogue lines mainly. In any case, a single line of 70 characters for example, that\u0027s not readable. Keep it short, evenly, readable.\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying to hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\tchange it to:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying \n\tto hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t- split sequences with long lines. Make it two lines on one sequence instead of a very long one.\n \n\n\n\t- no more than 2 lines per sequence for non dialogue lines. Same as above, split them so it\u0027s modified to 2 lines per sequence:\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, \n\twe\u0027re trying to hold the regime \n\tin Khartoum\n \n\n\n\tchange it to:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying \n\tto hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t- no 3 speakers per sequence. ONLY two maximum.\n \n\n\n\t- no dash on a line that isn\u0027t a dialogue. Example of what NOT to do:\n \n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\t- Inside a sequence, no speaker dashes on only one of the speakers. In this case, add the second speaker dash, (Subtitle Edit, Fix Errors, Add dash). It\u0027s all or nothing.\n \n\n\n\tIn order to tick the box  \"corrected\" for your subtitles, in addition to the above specificities, it must contain all the dialogue dashes as well. One dash per line! If it doesn\u0027t fit, then your lines are too long.\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\t- Text A\n \n\n\n\t- Text B\n \n\n\n\tAnd if you have dialogues that are very unequal, find a way to adjust them. Don\u0027t put a speaker with just one word, and the second speaker with a 50 character-sentence. It\u0027s common sense.\n \n\n\n\tNo super long lines on sequences. Avoid long lines as much as possible. We use a limit of 70 characters and find ways to resync them. The longer they are, the harder it is to read.\n \n\n\n\tMost of the above can be done easily with Subtitle Edit (Fix Errors is one of the way), and it\u0027s quick, so there\u0027s no excuses. You\u0027re responsible for the content YOU upload.\n \n\n\n\tYou can resync our subtitles to fit other versions. However, never modify them, alter them (unless there\u0027s text errors, missing dashes...). Keep the credits intact. You can add a line for your resync credit. In the comments box of your upload, you can add a line to indicate you resynced it from X version. When uploading them, keep the same properties. If they\u0027re corrected/HD/HI, tick the appropriate boxes. See explanation below for the icons.\n \n\n\n\tColored subtitles are allowed ONLY if you provide a non-colored version. They must be named \"VERSION.Colored\" to be differentiated by the system when downloading them. \n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tE. How to download files? What are all those icons near the files? What\u2019s Most updated ? \n\tDownloading files is an easy process.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThere are 3 type of downloads available:\n \n\n\n\tDownload - Button appears as \u201cDownload\u201d if no one edited the subtitle online and it means you\u2019re downloading exactly the same thing that was uploaded.\n \n\n\n\tDownload Original - Someone edited the subtitle online and you can choose to download the version without the edits that someone made online.\n \n\n\n\tDownload Most Updated - Someone edited the subtitle (probably corrected some text or timings) online and you choose to download the edited version\n \n\n\n\tThe icons:\n \n\n\n\t - Means the subtitle works for HD videos (720p, 1080p)\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t - The subtitle was corrected (proper case, dialogue dashes, no missing characters, good timings etc) and it\u2019s most likely one of the things that makes Addic7ed great!\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t - Subtitle contains additional text for the hearing impaired; for example [Door closes]\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tF. How to download subtitle packs? \n\tI agree, getting one file at a time isn\u2019t fun.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tLet\u2019s imagine you want to download the whole season 1 of Lost:\n \n\n\n\tYou search for Lost and land on its page.\n \n\n\n\tYou click the small checkbox near each subtitle you want to download.\n \n\n\n\tWhen you\u2019re done, click the \u201cMulti Download\u201d button located at the bottom (you must be logged in).\n \n\n\n\tYou\u2019ll get yourself a zip archive with all the goodies in it and a TXT as souvenir.\n \n\n\n\tWe know it\u2019s still a pain to search for files on these pages, but based on your suggestions we\u2019ll try to make the process easier.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. How do I customize my subtitles? \n\tOne great feature we offer is to customize subtitles \u201con the fly\u201d.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tGo to your Panel -\u0026gt; Edit profile and notice the \u201cRemove italics\u201d, \u201cReplace note\u201d and \u201cForce ANSI\u201d settings.\n \n\n\n\tChanging this will affect the subtitles you download. Don\u2019t like italics? Just tick the checkbox and your future downloads won\u2019t have lines in italics.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. What aired today?

If you\u0027re looking for fast subs poorly translated, go elsewhere.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tAnd for French users (because they represent a big part of the translators), READ all the rules. If you don\u0027t, don\u0027t be surprised you got banned for X reason. You were warned. Now, deal with it.\n \n\n\n\thttp://www.sub-talk.net/topic/3600-vous-voulez-aider-voici-comment-faq/\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA short lesson of history \n\tAlong with honeybunny, I started Addic7ed back in 2008. We were two people totally new in the subtitle scene (both as contributors and as website administrators) and with little experience in translating / syncing. From a user perspective we thought the subtitle scene can be improved (in both quality and release times). That\u2019s how Addic7ed was born. Slowly (but surely) we got visitors and team members. It was (and still is) a nice run and a nice experience that taught us a lot!\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWe met many awesome people (users and team members alike) that mean a lot! Without them Addic7ed can\u2019t be possible so a huge thanks for that.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tFinal words \n\tThis FAQ was written based on frequently asked questions in the past few years (and with help from staff members). I hope you will find your answers here. If somehow your questions are still unanswered, feel free to use the contact page to send me an email and I\u2019ll be glad to assist you.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThank you for reading this FAQ and thank you for using Addic7ed.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n",

            "text": "Addic7ed.com Official FAQ\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tKeep in mind this FAQ assumes you have \"English\" as default site language\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t1. Previously on Addic7ed\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. What is addic7ed.com? \n\tAddic7ed.com is the source for most English TV subtitles on the internet. You can\u2019t (and never will) find any video files here. Google is your friend on this one. The Addic7ed team provides ENGLISH subtitles, NOT translations. Our subs have our logo (or flag) next to them, that\u0027s how you\u0027llrecognize them. Translations aren\u0027t done by us but by regular users like you do. No need to ask us for them.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. Why subtitles? \n\tWe like helping people. Hearing impaired people can benefit (a lot!) from subtitles, and we\u2019re glad to do our part in helping them.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. How can I keep in touch with Addic7ed? \n\tYou can find us on Facebook , Twitter , our official IRC channel (#addic7ed on EFNet) and of course, the Sub-Talk forums.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. How much does it cost? \n\tAddic7ed.com is a free service and will stay that way... however donations are always welcomed and rewarded with VIP status (read more about VIP below). They help us pay for the servers, and are the basis for our future redesign.\n \n\n\n\tYou can support via Patreon for a monthly donation, via Bitcoin, or Paypal (contact us in private for the last two methods).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tE. What makes Addic7ed great? \n\tWe are dedicating our time to provide quality subtitles in the shortest time possible.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tDuring the last three four five six seven eight nine ten years, we have developed guidelines for subtitle production and correction that help us, and anyone willing, in reaching our goal. We are open to your feedback in order to improve and perfect them.\n \n\n\n\tWe welcome online translations / corrections: Members and users can correct a mistake they spot in a subtitle and the file will be instantly updated on the server, for anyone to download. That\u2019s why you might see \u201dMost updated\u201d on some files (more on this later).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tF. Who makes it possible? \n\tPeople behind Addic7ed are awesome! No, really, they are. They\u2019re volunteers too, meaning they do subtitles (even for shows they don\u2019t watch) in their spare time, for free. People who upload our subtitles with our flag are official team members. This means they follow our team guidelines (when correcting, syncing etc). However, everyone can participate and improve subtitles (and we encourage all to do so) if they see some mistakes in the text itself.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. Why does your layout bring me back memories of the 90\u2019s? \n\tWell, I agree with you. Graphics aren\u2019t our thing... There were a few attempts to fix this, and they failed miserably. There\u2019s a new thing in the works (again! and again!) that might bring Addic7ed to 2018 looks.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. Why are you against subtitle requests? \n\tWe have a lot on our minds (and schedule) already. We usually know what we have to release and we have a timeline for it. However, release times might vary.. so what today was released at 3PM, next week might be released at 8PM. As said above, we\u2019re doing it in our free time and that doesn\u2019t have a schedule.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tRequesting files won\u2019t speed the process. Our motto is \u201cwhen it\u2019s done\u201d, and most of the time, it\u2019s been \u201cdone\u201d.\n \n\n\n\tBy all means, thank the sub-makers and, when it happens, report any problems, but:\n \n\n\n\n\t\tDo NOT make requests for shows we do (those who have our logo), no matter how many days! Use the SubTalk Forums for special requests only.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo\u00a0NOT\u00a0make requests for leaked episodes. Maybe they\u0027ll be done, maybe they won\u0027t. Most likely, you\u0027ll have to wait for the airing.\u00a0\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT make requests for translations. They\u0027re made by users like you. If users don\u0027t have time, there won\u0027t be any translations. So you either participate, wait, or keep your hands away from your keyboard. Anyone requesting translations over and over will be banned.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post video links or refer to websites that contain video links for episodes. Try Google.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post links to other sites for episodes we haven\u0027t done yet, or complain that some episode is on XXX site. Wait patiently (and in silence is even better).\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT discuss shows or episodes - use the SubTalk Forums. You can give your opinion, but don\u0027t turn the comments page into a detailed analysis of an episode.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT post spoilers.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tDo NOT ask or whine about why it\u0027s taking so long,\u00a0or any variation of it. Doing so repeatedly may result in a ban. Syncers do have a life outside of Addic7ed.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIf you want to know if a sub will work with a particular episode/release, why not download it and try it?\u00a0(It\u0027s quicker than asking about it.)\n\t \n\t\n\t\tAbove all, respect the Addic7ed team, staff, and all users; abuse or discourtesy will result in a ban.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t2. General Subtitle questions\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. When does \u201cX\u201d subtitle come out? \n\tPlease read above. The \u201cWhy are you against subtitle requests\u201d answer pretty much explains it.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. Why do some subs take time to be released/are released late? \n\tFirst of all, let\u2019s define late. When I started watching TV shows (and Addic7ed was not even a domain name) I waited 1-2 days (even 2 weeks for Psych subtitles) for some subtitles to be uploaded to subtitle websites... and even that wasn\u2019t \u201clate\u201d. We\u2019re all humans and we do it in our free time. No free time =/= no fast release.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. Why do I often see a lot of mistakes and misspelled words in translation? (made on site)? \n\tAddic7ed.com has a \"wikipedia like\" feature. That means anyone with an account can translate a subtitle online. The good thing is, the more people work on a file, the faster it\u2019s done... unfortunately the downside is that some people might make spelling mistakes. We\u2019re constantly trying to correct such mistakes, by relying on our moderators. But we need your help to do it. Whenever you see errors in subtitles, please try to correct the file yourself or click the Report button so that moderators can do their job properly and check what has been done.\u00a0 However, keep in mind that they too have a life.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. I just uploaded 185 episodes of this cool series \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d from 1978. Why you guys removed it from \u201cNew Releases\u201d?\n \n\n\n\tWell, no argument there. \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d was probably a good series, and our website layout might look like it\u2019s 1990 all over again, but the \u201cNew releases\u201d section is only used for shows that aired \u201crecently\u201d (in human time, that means ~1 week).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t3. Users and general website questions\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. Why do I need an account? \n\tYou can take full advantage of our services without having an account... however there are some limitations for visitors:\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\t\tCan\u2019t post comments / send PM\n\t \n\t\n\t\tCan\u2019t upload subtitles\n\t \n\t\n\t\tCan\u2019t translate online / edit online\n\t \n\t\n\t\tCan\u2019t have a list of shows and episodes you\u2019ve watched over time\n\t \n\t\n\t\tCan\u2019t make personal RSS and follow shows you\u2019re expecting subtitles for (more on this below)\n\t \n\t\n\t\tYou\u2019re limited to 15 files / 24 hours (more on this below)\n\t \n\n\n\tSigning up is free and lifts most of the above limits.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. I registered but I can\u0027t log in. Now what? \n\tFirst, you can only create one account. So, if you already used your email in the past to create one, you can\u0027t do it again. If you don\u0027t remember your old account, or can\u0027t log in now, just visit the contact page, send me an email with your username you tried to register and we\u0027ll fix the problem.\n \n\n\n\tIf you have an activation problem after clicking the activation email, try to log in. If it works fine, forget about the activation, it\u0027s not always necessary.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. I\u0027m registered but I can\u0027t translate, edit or comment. Why?\n \n\n\n\tIn order to do all of the above, you\u0027ll need to wait a few days. We set a limit for new users to avoid trolls. Don\u0027t ask how long it takes, we won\u0027t say.\n \n\n\n\tIf you\u0027ve been a user for more than a few days and can\u0027t do the above, then you\u0027ve likely been blocked from translation by the moderation. Check your private messages.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. Which are the user classes? \n\tThere are 3 classes you can obtain without much effort:\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\t\tUnregistered - Just visit the website\n\t \n\t\n\t\tRegistered - Register, login into your account\n\t \n\t\n\t\tVIP - Obtained via participating in VIP giveaway contests, being a helpful member of the community or donating (one possible way is via Patreon and if you prefer PayPal, please contact us directly). There is no minimal amount required.\n\t \n\n\n\tOther classes are:\n \n\n\n\tTeam Member - Official team members (can be trusted uploaders, etc). Privileges: VIP+\n \n\n\n\tModerator - Keeping the website clean and tidy. Privileges: Team Member+\n \n\n\n\tAdministrator - All of the above... They\u0027re the big bosses. Don\u0027t mess with them. They bite.\n \n\n\n\tUsers can be promoted to Moderator if they prove to be worthy. Users can apply to Team Member (more about that later).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tE. What are the privileges you\u2019re talking about?\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\t\tRegistered - Has an increased download limit to 40 subtitles / 24 hours\n\t \n\n\n\tCan post comments / send PM.\n \n\n\n\tStart online translations and (or) edit files.\n \n\n\n\tCan download subtitle packs.\n \n\n\n\tCan add 10 shows to \u201cFavorites\u201d or keep track of shows he/she is following. (currently unavailable)\n \n\n\n\tCan mark episodes as \u201cWatched\u201d to keep track of shows / episodes viewed. (currently unavailable)\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\t\tVIP - Has an increased download limit to 80 subtitles / 24 hours,\n\t \n\n\n\tCan do all of the above including unlimited number of shows as \u201cFavorites\u201d. (currently unavailable)\n \n\n\n\tCan feel good about themselves for helping the community.\n \n\n\n\tIs awesome just because he writes comments with a blue font.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tF. Download limits? Not sure I like it! We\u2019re talking 50Kb files here. \n\tYou\u2019re right. However, the download limit serves its purpose. The Addic7ed code had lots of optimizations done to better handle the download system. We have about 3 million downloads per month, so limits had to be enforced. This also prevented bots from mass downloading subtitles. I think the 40 files / 24 hours is a pretty reasonable limit for normal users. Limit may increase in time, so this values might change.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tKeep in mind download resets in 24 hours. If you download a file now, it will disappear from your limit 24 hours from now, not at 12AM tonight.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. How do I check my limits? \n\tGo to your \u201cPanel\u201c. You\u2019\u2019 find the limit in the information box there (Downloads today section). Clicking that will show you some detailed info about your last downloads.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. I downloaded a subtitle but the website counted 3 downloads, instead of one. What\u2019s up with that? \n\tYou\u2019re most probably running a Download Manager / Accelerator. Please try disabling it and download a file. Should all work great after that. If your software supports it, make a rule to disable it on Addic7ed.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tI. I donated but my account has not yet been updated to VIP \n\tThe only reason is because you have to warn us after you make a donation, if you haven\u0027t specified your username. Just send an email to chamallow@addic7ed.com with your PayPal email or transaction ID and your Addic7ed.com username and it will be updated as soon as possible.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tJ. How do I manage my account? \n\tYou can click the \u201cMy Panel\u201d button on top of every page. You will find there settings such as change password, set gender, hide online status, or subtitle specific settings like remove italics (read below).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tK. How do I get an avatar? \n\tWell, this one is rather simple. Go to Gravatar.com and assign an avatar to your email address. It will automatically be updated on Addic7ed too (if you used the same email address when you registered your account).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t4. General Website Features\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. What\u2019s \u201cShows I\u2019ve watched\u201d? \n\tEver wondered how many shows you saw or how much time you spent viewing them?\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWell, that\u2019s it. Just add shows / episodes you have watched to the list and you\u2019ll get some interesting data out of it.\n \n\n\n\tVisit the episode page on Addic7ed and tick \u201dViewed\u201d or go to \u201dAir Dates\u201d and look for a show to \u201dbulk view\u201d entire seasons with one click.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. I can\u2019t seem to find my way around the website! \n\tAddic7ed is very, very! easy to use. Unlike other websites, we have show pages and episode pages.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tHere\u2019s an example of a show page and here\u2019s one of an episode page .\n \n\n\n\tAs you can see, the episode page has all the subtitles for that episode in one place (all versions, all languages).\n \n\n\n\tThere are 3 ways you can find subtitles on the website:\n \n\n\n\tBy using Quick Search dropdown - It lists all the shows we have. Click to open the list and start typing the first characters of the show; for example, typing \u201cPriso\u201d would most likely jump you to \u201cPrison Break\u201d.\n \n\n\n\tBy using the search box - Pretty self explanatory.\n \n\n\n\tBy visiting \u201cBrowse\u201d located on top of every page - Call this the \u201cadvanced\u201d quick search if you want\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. How to upload files? \n\tThis may be a little confusing at first, but trust me, once you do it 1-2 times you\u2019ll find it simple.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tAs explained above, we have episode pages.\n \n\n\n\tWhen you upload a subtitle for an episode that doesn\u2019t exist (search every time before you upload anything) you must use the \u201cUpload\u201d button located on top of every page. \n\tThis will create an episode page for the show you selected, with your subtitle as the first uploaded for that episode.\n \n\n\n\tTo upload a subtitle for an episode that already exists, go to the episode page and click \u201cUpload a new version\u201d located at the bottom of the file list (and above the episode comments).\n \n\n\n\tA new version can be either another resync, a corrected file or a different language.\n \n\n\n\tReminder: You can\u0027t create an episode for shows that we do. It means that if you try, the show in the dropdown menu will be greyed out. You\u0027re not authorized to upload it. You\u0027ll have to wait until our English subtitles are ready, and we create the episode. \n\tTrying to bypass our systems may result in a ban.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. Is there rules to follow regarding how subtitles should be?\n \n\n\n\tYes, there are. We don\u0027t accept raw subtitles on our site, which means that if subtitles have no corrections at all, we will delete them. \n\tThey must be:\n \n\n\n\t- NO MACHINE TRANSLATED SUBS ON OUR SITE.\n \n\n\n\t- in capitalized case (names ought to be capitalized, no capitalization after commas or at the beginning of each new sequence...)\n \n\n\n\t \n\t- they don\u0027t contain long lines. Try to split them in half if they\u0027re very long. The team splits lines longer than 40. It\u0027s easier to read and doable in a few seconds with softwares like Subtitle Workshop, Subtitle Edit, Aegisub\u2026 But we don\u0027t split them in half if they\u0027re below 40 characters per line. Valid for non dialogue lines mainly. In any case, a single line of 70 characters for example, that\u0027s not readable. Keep it short, evenly, readable.\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying to hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\tchange it to:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying \n\tto hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t- split sequences with long lines. Make it two lines on one sequence instead of a very long one.\n \n\n\n\t- no more than 2 lines per sequence for non dialogue lines. Same as above, split them so it\u0027s modified to 2 lines per sequence:\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, \n\twe\u0027re trying to hold the regime \n\tin Khartoum\n \n\n\n\tchange it to:\n \n\n\n\tSequence 1\n \n\n\n\tIn the meantime, we\u0027re trying \n\tto hold the regime in Khartoum\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t- no 3 speakers per sequence. ONLY two maximum.\n \n\n\n\t- no dash on a line that isn\u0027t a dialogue. Example of what NOT to do:\n \n\n\n\t\n \n\n\n\t- Inside a sequence, no speaker dashes on only one of the speakers. In this case, add the second speaker dash, (Subtitle Edit, Fix Errors, Add dash). It\u0027s all or nothing.\n \n\n\n\tIn order to tick the box  \"corrected\" for your subtitles, in addition to the above specificities, it must contain all the dialogue dashes as well. One dash per line! If it doesn\u0027t fit, then your lines are too long.\n \n\n\n\tExample:\n \n\n\n\t- Text A\n \n\n\n\t- Text B\n \n\n\n\tAnd if you have dialogues that are very unequal, find a way to adjust them. Don\u0027t put a speaker with just one word, and the second speaker with a 50 character-sentence. It\u0027s common sense.\n \n\n\n\tNo super long lines on sequences. Avoid long lines as much as possible. We use a limit of 70 characters and find ways to resync them. The longer they are, the harder it is to read.\n \n\n\n\tMost of the above can be done easily with Subtitle Edit (Fix Errors is one of the way), and it\u0027s quick, so there\u0027s no excuses. You\u0027re responsible for the content YOU upload.\n \n\n\n\tYou can resync our subtitles to fit other versions. However, never modify them, alter them (unless there\u0027s text errors, missing dashes...). Keep the credits intact. You can add a line for your resync credit. In the comments box of your upload, you can add a line to indicate you resynced it from X version. When uploading them, keep the same properties. If they\u0027re corrected/HD/HI, tick the appropriate boxes. See explanation below for the icons.\n \n\n\n\tColored subtitles are allowed ONLY if you provide a non-colored version. They must be named \"VERSION.Colored\" to be differentiated by the system when downloading them. \n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tE. How to download files? What are all those icons near the files? What\u2019s Most updated ? \n\tDownloading files is an easy process.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThere are 3 type of downloads available:\n \n\n\n\tDownload - Button appears as \u201cDownload\u201d if no one edited the subtitle online and it means you\u2019re downloading exactly the same thing that was uploaded.\n \n\n\n\tDownload Original - Someone edited the subtitle online and you can choose to download the version without the edits that someone made online.\n \n\n\n\tDownload Most Updated - Someone edited the subtitle (probably corrected some text or timings) online and you choose to download the edited version\n \n\n\n\tThe icons:\n \n\n\n\t - Means the subtitle works for HD videos (720p, 1080p)\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t - The subtitle was corrected (proper case, dialogue dashes, no missing characters, good timings etc) and it\u2019s most likely one of the things that makes Addic7ed great!\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t - Subtitle contains additional text for the hearing impaired; for example [Door closes]\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tF. How to download subtitle packs? \n\tI agree, getting one file at a time isn\u2019t fun.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tLet\u2019s imagine you want to download the whole season 1 of Lost:\n \n\n\n\tYou search for Lost and land on its page.\n \n\n\n\tYou click the small checkbox near each subtitle you want to download.\n \n\n\n\tWhen you\u2019re done, click the \u201cMulti Download\u201d button located at the bottom (you must be logged in).\n \n\n\n\tYou\u2019ll get yourself a zip archive with all the goodies in it and a TXT as souvenir.\n \n\n\n\tWe know it\u2019s still a pain to search for files on these pages, but based on your suggestions we\u2019ll try to make the process easier.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tG. How do I customize my subtitles? \n\tOne great feature we offer is to customize subtitles \u201con the fly\u201d.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tGo to your Panel -\u0026gt; Edit profile and notice the \u201cRemove italics\u201d, \u201cReplace note\u201d and \u201cForce ANSI\u201d settings.\n \n\n\n\tChanging this will affect the subtitles you download. Don\u2019t like italics? Just tick the checkbox and your future downloads won\u2019t have lines in italics.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tH. What aired today? When does my favorite show start? \n\tThere\u2019s a schedule here that updates every day.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tIf you\u2019re looking for TV show air dates, please click the \u201c Air Dates \u201c button located on top. Lots of useful information there.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t5. Translating and editing files\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. How do I translate a file online? What are the advantages? \n\tAddic7ed offers a wiki like system for translating and editing files. Anyone can translate files if they\u2019re logged in.\n \n\n\n\tHowever, if you don\u0027t master your language, don\u0027t bother translating. You\u0027ll waste our moderators\u0027 time and everyone else who\u0027s participating by doing a bad job.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tGo to an episode page and click \u201cNew Translation\u201d link near the version you want to translate.\n \n\n\n\tYou will be taken to a page where you have to select the source language (translating from) and the new language you want to translate (translating to). Respect the rules shown!\n \n\n\n\tYou now have the subtitle lines, timing and text inside a table.\n \n\n\n\tAll you have to do is click the\n \n\n\n- Untranslated -\n\n\n\tbox, translate and click \u201cSave\u201d .\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tMore people can translate into the same language at the same time, so the file is completed faster. But FAST doesn\u0027t mean the quality must be bad. We prefer QUALITY over speed!\n \n\n\n\tFor obvious quality reasons, anyone uploading translations using\u00a0automated software (like Google Translate) will be banned.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. How do I edit files? Why should I edit files? \n\tIf you\u2019re enjoying a show with subtitles from Addic7ed and you notice one or more typos, please come back to the website and correct them.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThis improves the overall quality of the content and helps the community.\n \n\n\n\tAll you have to do is go to the episode page and click \u201cView and Edit\u201d near the version / language you\u2019ve noticed the error.\n \n\n\n\tSearch for the line / text, click on the \u201cText\u201d box, make the changes and click \u201cSave\u201d.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t6. Random\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA. Is it me, or has development been kinda slow lately? \n\tNo, it\u2019s not you. It has been kinda slow, and I apologize for that. Some were my fault, some weren\u2019t. However, I expect by the time 2018 ends, we\u2019ll have a better Addic7ed website for all to enjoy.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tB. I want to help the team to sync English subtitles. Whom should I contact? \n\tPlease use this contact page. Select the \u201cJoining the team\u201d subject.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tC. I have a suggestion / I encountered a bug / I want to contact support \n\tAgain, use the same contact page as above. You\u2019ll usually get an answer in less than 24 hours.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tIf you encounter errors or bugs, please give as much information as possible (screenshots, what the error was, what\u2019s your browser / operating system etc).\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tD. Why are the translations so slow? Why does the percentage diminish?  \n\tAs said previously, translations are made by regular users like you. If no one has time or wants to participate, there won\u0027t be any done. No need to whine or be angry. That\u0027s how it is. \n\tAs for the percentage dropping, is we\u0027re notified of users doing a bad work, our moderators are there to deal with those, and remove their participation if it really sucks. If you\u0027re looking for fast subs poorly translated, go elsewhere.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tAnd for French users (because they represent a big part of the translators), READ all the rules. If you don\u0027t, don\u0027t be surprised you got banned for X reason. You were warned. Now, deal with it.\n \n\n\n\thttp://www.sub-talk.net/topic/3600-vous-voulez-aider-voici-comment-faq/\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tA short lesson of history \n\tAlong with honeybunny, I started Addic7ed back in 2008. We were two people totally new in the subtitle scene (both as contributors and as website administrators) and with little experience in translating / syncing. From a user perspective we thought the subtitle scene can be improved (in both quality and release times). That\u2019s how Addic7ed was born. Slowly (but surely) we got visitors and team members. It was (and still is) a nice run and a nice experience that taught us a lot!\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tWe met many awesome people (users and team members alike) that mean a lot! Without them Addic7ed can\u2019t be possible so a huge thanks for that.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tFinal words \n\tThis FAQ was written based on frequently asked questions in the past few years (and with help from staff members). I hope you will find your answers here. If somehow your questions are still unanswered, feel free to use the contact page to send me an email and I\u2019ll be glad to assist you.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n\n\n\tThank you for reading this FAQ and thank you for using Addic7ed.\n \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n \n"
