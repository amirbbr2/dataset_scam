          <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") will explain how we process and collect your ("user", "you" or "your") data when you install and use our Ads Skipper browser extension and any other feature or service that we Ads Skipper offer or provide you with therein (collectively "Extension"), as well as how such data may be used or shared with others, how we safeguard it and you may exercise your rights related to your Personal Data (as such term is defined below), among others, according to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) where applicable.</p>

          <p>In the event you are a California resident and the CCPA apply to you – please review our <a href="ccpa_privacy_notice.php">CCPA Privacy Notice</a></p>

          <p>This Policy is an integral part of the Extension’s Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms. YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT TO US AND WE THEREFORE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THIS POLICY THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU INSTALL OR USE OUR EXTENSION.</p>

          <p>We reserve the right to periodically amend or revise the Policy. The revised terms will be effective immediately upon the display of the revised Policy. The last revision date will be reflected in the “Last Modified” heading. In the event of amendments that will majorly change our privacy practices, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an applicable notification of such amendment. We recommend you review this Policy periodically to check for any such amendment.</p>

            <li>(i) Information that identifies a person or can with a reasonable amount of effort identify a person ("Personal Data");</li>
            <li>(ii) information that is collected and processed by us through your use of the Extension that is non-personal and cannot identify a person ("Non-Personal Data"). If we combine Personal Data with Non-Personal Data, the combined data will be treated as Personal Data for as long as it remains combined.</li>

          </p>

          <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>We and our service providers may use cookies and similar common tracking technologies such as, but not limited to, web beacons, pixels, and user agents. These tracking technologies are assigned and stored on the device which you installed the Extension in the form of small pieces of information. Cookies and these other tracking technologies are very helpful and can be used for a variety of purposes, including: enabling you to navigate between pages efficiently, enabling automatic activation of specific features, and to customize your experience by providing you with relevant content for example in the form of an advertisement. Please visit: www.allaboutcookies.org to learn more about cookies.</p>

          <p>You are able to disable cookies or limit the data collection of such cookies through the settings of your device or that are available through your browser.

Furthermore, it is important to note that, if you decide to disable certain cookies, this may result in certain parts of the Extension not functioning properly.</p>

          <h2>Third Party Content</h2>
          <p>Some of the content that is available through the Extension may redirect you to third party content. Such third party’s privacy policy, and not this Policy, will apply to your interaction with such content in this situation.

We have put a variety of security measures in place in order to protect your Personal Data which correspond with industry standards including physical, technical and administrative measures, as are required in accordance with applicable law. We will make a reasonable effort to notify you and any applicable supervisory authority if we become aware of a security breach that has affected your Personal Data, if we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>

          <p>Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will retain the Personal Data that we collect only for as long as we need to in order to provide you with the various features that are available through our Extension and in order to operate our business. We will also retain your Personal Data if we need it in order to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</p>
